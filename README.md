# KryOS
### What is KryOS?
KryOS is a simple 32 bit OS on C++ and nasm.
it has simple video and keyboard driver, all idt and gdt descriptors
i think its kinda cool ngl
it like has vbe, custom framebuffer console... and also i had tested it on old netbook lmao
optimizations sucks but ill work on it later

### How to build this?
first of all you should have packages like:  nasm, xorriso, mtools, build-essential, gcc-multilib, grub-common, grub-pc-bin, and qemu if u r going to test it on emulator, or use any other vm, i dont really care lmao
how you install it? bro do you think i know? google will help ya.

So, when you have all the dependencies, you shall just execute ```make rebuild``` and ```make run-iso``` if u r going to launch it in qemu

### And... that's all lol
good luck
